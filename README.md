# Twitter Watch
Twitter Watch tracks tweets and replies of selected accounts, extracts information such as conversation threads, active audiences, and sentiment scores, and provides REST API endpoints. 
The source code is available on GitHub or another code hosting website. An extra score can be obtained by creating a sentiment metric, using AI for a summary description, and making a website.
